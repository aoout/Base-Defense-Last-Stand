# VANGUARD OPERATIVE FIELD MANUAL

**Status**: DECLASSIFIED
**Distribution**: GENERAL INFANTRY

## Welcome to the Front
You are a Vanguard Operative. Your goal is survival. Your method is superior firepower.

This document serves as a quick reference. For deep technical specifications, refer to the **Ship Computer** in-game.

## Core Directives

1.  **PROTECT THE BASE**: The Molecular Printer is your lifeline. If it is destroyed, you are extracted, but the mission is a failure.
2.  **HARVEST SCRAPS**: Every enemy kill provides carbon/metal particulates ("Scraps"). Use these to build defenses.
3.  **ADAPT**: The planet is hostile. Use the environment or it will use you.

## Controls

| Action | Key | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Move** | `W` `A` `S` `D` | Keep moving. Stationary targets are dead targets. |
| **Shoot** | `Left Click` | Short controlled bursts improve accuracy. |
| **Scope** | `Right Click` | Extends view range. Critical for Snipers. |
| **Reload** | `R` | **Tactical Tip**: Reload *before* the mag is empty. |
| **Grenade** | `G` | Clears swarms. Limited capacity. |
| **Lure** | `L` | **Warning**: Enrages the swarm. Skipping wave timers grants massive resource bonuses. |
| **Interact** | `E` | Build/Upgrade Turrets at hardpoints. |
| **Shop** | `B` | Access Supply Depot (Must be near Base). |
| **Backpack** | `C` | Manage inventory and weapon modules. |
| **Command** | `TAB` | Issue orders to AI Squadmates. |

## The Enemy

*   **Grunts**: Weak alone, deadly in packs.
*   **Rushers**: Fast. Orange shell. Prioritize immediately.
*   **Tanks**: heavily armored. Kite them.
*   **Kamikazes**: They glow purple. Do not let them get close.
*   **Vipers**: Ranged spitters. They will whittle down your base from afar.

## Advanced Tactics

*   **Turret Synergy**: Use **Gauss Turrets** for close-range DPS and **Missile Turrets** (Level 2) for global map coverage.
*   **Damage Types**:
    *   **Explosive**: Good vs Swarms.
    *   **Piercing** (Pulse/Flamer): Good vs Lines of enemies.
    *   **High Caliber** (Sniper): Good vs Bosses/Tanks.
*   **Extraction**: If you are overwhelmed in Exploration Mode, your progress (Scraps/Items) is saved, even if the mission fails. Don't be afraid to take risks.

*Good luck, Commander.*
