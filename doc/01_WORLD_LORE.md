**Classification**: COMMANDER EYES ONLY

## 1. The Collapse (2199 A.D.)
Humanity's golden age of interstellar expansion ended abruptly. The deep-space mining vessel *USG Ishimura-IV* returned from Sector 7G carrying a geological sample containing a dormant, microscopic spore.

Upon exposure to Earth's nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, the spore exited dormancy. It did not infect hosts like a virus; it **bonded** with them. It triggered a rapid cellular rewriting process, fusing organic tissue with synthetic polymers and metals found in the environment.

Within 5 years, 80% of the Sol System's population was converted into "The Scourge".

## 2. Project Vanguard
The survivors retreated to the **Colossus-Class** Heavy Cruisers—massive, self-sustaining city-ships designed to drift in deep space, far from infected worlds. However, the fleet requires raw materials to maintain life support and hull integrity.

**Project Vanguard** was initiated to deploy elite, expendable operatives back onto infected worlds. Their goal is not to win the war—that is impossible—but to secure resources ("Scraps") to keep the fleet alive for one more day.

## 3. Technology: Molecular Printing
The core technology of the Vanguard program is **Molecular Printing**.

*   **The Base**: The structure you defend is not a habitat; it is a massive, industrial-grade Molecular Furnace and Printer.
*   **Scraps**: This is the currency of the game. In lore, "Scraps" are harvested carbon, silicate, and metal particulates.
*   **The Loop**: When you kill a biological enemy, the Base's intake fans vacuum up the residual carbon dust. This dust is instantly printed into new ammunition, turret components, or armor plating.
    *   *You are killing the aliens to print the bullets to kill more aliens.*

## 4. The Enemy: The Mycelium Scourge
The Scourge is a hive-mind intelligence that repurposes biomass for combat. It does not have a culture; it has a directive: **Consume and Expand**.

### Communication
The Scourge communicates via a subspace psionic field. Vanguard operatives using the Neural Link interface often report auditory hallucinations—whispers from the hive mind. This is represented in the game's "Ship Computer" lore entries regarding "Phantom Signals".

### Evolution
The Scourge adapts to its environment.
*   **High Oxygen**: Increases metabolic rate (Higher HP).
*   **High Sulfur**: Used to synthesize volatile acids (Explosive/Corrosive attacks).
*   **Gene Strength**: Over time, the Hive refines its DNA, leading to "Apex Strains" (Bosses).
