# Archive Record: The Mycelium Scourge

**Date**: 2248 A.D.  
**Clearance**: Level 4 (Commander)

## The Collapse
In 2199, deep-space mining vessel *USG Ishimura-IV* brought back samples from Sector 7G. Among the ore was a dormant, microscopic spore. When exposed to oxygen-rich atmospheres, it rapidly mutated, bonding with organic matter to create what we now call **"The Scourge"**.

Within 5 years, Earth's population was reduced by 80%. The Scourge does not just kill; it repurposes. Biomass is consumed and reconfigured into combat-efficient forms designed to eliminate resistance and spread the infection.

## Project Vanguard
The remnants of humanity retreated to the **Colossus-Class** Heavy Cruisers, massive city-ships designed for deep space survival. *Project Vanguard* is the military initiative to reclaim lost colonies and resource depots.

You are a **Vanguard Operative**. Your mission is to drop onto hostile worlds, establish a perimeter around critical resource extractors (The Base), and hold the line while resources ("Scraps") are teleported up to the Colossus.

## The Enemy (Xeno-Forms)

### Grunt
The most common mutation. Likely formed from civilian biomass. rudimentary motor functions preserved, but higher brain functions replaced by a hive-mind aggression signal.

### Rusher
A mutation favoring fast-twitch muscle fibers. Often evolved from local fauna rather than humans. Their carapace has hardened into a distinct orange chitin.

### Kamikaze
These units are walking biological bombs. The Scourge concentrates highly volatile acids in a sac on their back. The hive mind treats them as disposable munitions to breach fortifications.

### Apex Strains (Bosses)
- **The Hive Lord (Red)**: A mobile spawning node. It contains a functioning uterus-analogue capable of rapid cloning.
- **The Cobalt Reaper (Blue)**: A heavily mutated security unit, possibly integrated with military exosuit technology, allowing it to project plasma energy.
- **The Plague Bringer (Purple)**: A walking terraforming engine. It spews enzymes designed to break down inorganic matter (like your base walls) into consumable slush.

## Economic System: Scraps
"Scraps" are not just currency; they are raw matter. The Base contains a Molecular Printer. By feeding it raw material gathered from the environment (or harvested from enemy remains), the printer can fabricate ammunition, turrets, and weapon modules in real-time.

### Neuro-Reactive Lures (Wave Acceleration)
Vanguard scientists discovered that Scourge biomass remains neurologically active even after structural death. By synthesizing a pheromone mimic—dubbed "The Lure"—operatives can forcefully draw distant swarms toward their position.

The immediate proximity of the swarm forces the Molecular Printer to work in overdrive, harvesting particulate matter from the rushing enemy bodies before they are even killed. This manifests as a bonus yield of Scraps, rewarding operatives who are confident enough to fight the horde on their own terms.

## Protocol
1. **Drop**: Secure the landing zone.
2. **Build**: Establish automated defenses.
3. **Harvest**: Collect Scraps.
4. **Survive**: Hold until the sector is cleared or extraction is mandatory.
